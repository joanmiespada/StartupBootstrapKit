### What is Startup Bootstrap Kit (SBK)?

This repo isn't neither framework nor library. It's just a KIT, so means this a functional toolset ready-to-use for a developers when you are modeling a business with software. 
The objective is spread techniques/best practices/configurations when you are building software end-to-end with Javascript in Front-end and Back-end.

Why `startup`? Mainly for two reasons:  
1) When you are building software and you don't have any idea if it will be accepted by the user or not, you should produce code as fast as you can. Start testing with the user is crucial. Thus, you shouldn't waste time with configurations, bundles, dependencies, etcetera. 
2) When your are building an idea from scratch is the best time to settle a strong base of code with the idea to keep the complexity under control and
keep the performance high. Thus, we want create a functional solution in production without write spaguetti-code.  

This repo has been designed bear in mind these two points.      

### Which technologies will you find here?
